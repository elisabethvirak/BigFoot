# Bigfoot Reports
This project is an extension of ETL-Project with Tenderblindboi and brooketantillo.

We found our Bigfoot Reports dataset on data.world. It consisted of two CSV files, a location file and a geocoded file, and one JSON file.

The purpose of this project is to collect weather data for each siting within the past 50 years (1970-2020).
